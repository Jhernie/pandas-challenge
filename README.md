This repository houses an analysis on district-wide and school specific data from a given dataset. Please open the "Evangelista_PyCitySchools.ipynb" 
file to access the respective data tables used for this analysis. 

At first blush, given the table below, there does not appear to be a strong correlation between a school's overall budget and the "overall passing" 
value which serves as a metric to gauge student performance and academic outcomes. This is interested because it negates a commonly held belief that
more per-pupil funding will enable more favorable student outcomes.
